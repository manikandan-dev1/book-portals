                My Mother comes home from a business trip and she asks her little son, "well,mani, how was your life
                with father when I was away?"
                "Everything was fine,mum,"the little boy says. "Daddy took me to the middle of the lake by every morning
                and I swam home alone."
                "wasn't it difficilt for you to swim?" "oh,no,mum, the only problem was that I had to get out of the bag
                first."
